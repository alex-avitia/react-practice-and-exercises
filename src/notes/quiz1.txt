/* Notes from the first Udemy React quiz (9/10 score) */




1) What kind of code do you write with React.js?

    Declarative Javascript Code

2) What is "JSX"?

    A special, non-standard syntax which is enabled in React projects.

3) Why is React all about "components"?

    Every UI in the end is made up of multiple building blocks (= components),
    hence it makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combinations of components".

4) What does "declarative" mean?

    You define the desired outcome (e.g. a target UI) and let the library (React) figure out the steps.

5) What is a "React Component"?

    It's a Javascript function which typically returns HTML (JSX) code that should be displayed.

6) How many custom React components must a React app have?

    There's no minimum or maximum.

7) What does a "component tree" mean?

    It means that you have a root node which then has more components nested beneath it.

8) How do you pass data between components?

    Via "custom HTML attributes" (AKA "props").

9) How can you output dynamic data in React components (i.e. in the returned JSX code)?

    You can use single curly braces (opening & closing) with any JS expression between them.

10) [RESOLVED] Which statement is correct?

    [INITIAL] With React, you build multiple sibling component trees that are then mounted into the same DOM node.

    [CORRECT] With React, you build a component tree with one root component that's mounted into a DOM node.
